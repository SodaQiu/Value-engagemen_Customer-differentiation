# When Transaction Value and Relationship Signals Diverge: Progressive Customer Differentiation in Pet E-Commerce

## Description

This repository contains the analysis code used to support reproducibility for a study of **value-engagement misalignment and retention heterogeneity in pet e-commerce**.

The study examines whether observable early relationship signals provide additional information beyond early transaction value, and whether high-value, low-engagement (HVLE) customers differ in subsequent fourth-purchase outcomes.

The analysis follows a three-stage framework: transaction-value identification, value-engagement misalignment diagnosis, and within-segment non-completion risk stratification.

## Research Framework

Customers are classified according to early transaction value and observable engagement signals:

```text
HVHE = High Value, High Engagement
HVLE = High Value, Low Engagement
LVHE = Low Value, High Engagement
LVLE = Low Value, Low Engagement
```

The analyses compare subsequent churn across engagement groups, examine behavioral characteristics associated with HVLE membership, and predict non-completion risk within the HVLE segment.

## Core Variable Definitions

The main analyses focus on customers who completed their first three purchases.

### Subsequent Retention Outcome

```text
survive_yn = 1 -> fourth purchase observed
survive_yn = 0 -> fourth purchase not observed

noncompletion_yn = 1 - survive_yn -> fourth purchase not observed

churn_yn = 1   -> fourth purchase not observed
churn_yn = 0   -> fourth purchase observed
```

### Observable Early Engagement

Two engagement-related signals are used:

```text
review_written_yn
push_notification_consent_yn
```

They are combined as:

```text
engagement_count =
review_written_yn + push_notification_consent_yn

high_engagement = 1 if engagement_count >= 1
high_engagement = 0 if engagement_count == 0
```

### Early Transaction Value

Early transaction value is measured using:

```text
order_unit_price
```

The median among customers who completed their first three purchases is used as the primary cutoff:

```text
high_value = 1 if order_unit_price >= median
high_value = 0 otherwise
```

For regression models using transaction value as a continuous covariate, `order_unit_price` is log-transformed because of its strongly right-skewed distribution.

## Analysis Structure

### Study 1: Engagement and Subsequent Churn

Study 1 examines whether observable early engagement signals provide information about subsequent churn beyond early transaction value.

#### H1

```text
churn_yn ~ engagement_count
churn_yn ~ engagement_count + log_order_unit_price
```

Supplementary analyses include signal-configuration and incremental-value models, together with a continuous value x engagement interaction.

#### H2

Among high-value customers, HVLE and HVHE customers are compared using:

```text
churn_yn ~ HVLE_yn
churn_yn ~ HVLE_yn + log_order_unit_price
```

### Study 2A: HVLE Membership

Study 2A examines behavioral characteristics associated with HVLE membership among high-value customers.

The analyses focus on:

* single-category versus multi-category purchasing; and
* exploratory associations between private-brand purchasing (`pb_purchase_yn`) and HVLE membership.

### Study 2B: HVLE Non-Completion Risk Prediction

Study 2B examines fourth-purchase non-completion risk heterogeneity within the HVLE segment.

The prediction target is:

```text
noncompletion_yn = 1 - survive_yn
```

The following models are compared:

```text
Random Forest
LightGBM
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Multilayer Perceptron
```

The prediction script is `Study_2/survival_prediction/prediction_exam.py`, with shared Stage 3 utilities in `Study_2/survival_prediction/stage3_modeling_utils.py`.

SHAP is implemented in `Study_2/survival_prediction/LR_model_shap.py` to interpret LR predictions within the HVLE segment.

## Conclusion

Based on the above results, this study proposes a customer management framework of **transaction value identification, misalignment diagnosis, and internal retention stratification**. This framework can provide a basis for pet e-commerce platforms to further differentiate high-value customers and optimize the allocation of limited customer retention resources.
